Here's a simplified Clarity smart contract project based on your request: **Skill Trees with Token Unlocks**, where completing learning paths allows users to mint NFTs. The project includes **two core functions** and a **README file**.

;; Skill Trees with Token Unlocks
;; Users complete skill paths to mint NFTs as proof of achievement

(define-non-fungible-token skill-nft uint)

;; Track completed users per skill path
(define-map skill-completions (tuple (user principal) (path-id uint)) bool)

;; Track minted NFTs
(define-data-var nft-id-counter uint u0)

;; Errors
(define-constant err-already-completed (err u100))
(define-constant err-not-completed (err u101))

;; Complete a skill path (admin only for simplicity)
(define-public (complete-skill-path (user principal) (path-id uint))
  (begin

;; Mint NFT for a completed skill path
(define-public (mint-skill-nft (path-id uint))

        (try! (nft-mint? skill-nft new-id tx-sender))

 1. **Project Title**

Skill Trees with Token Unlocks**


 2. **Project Description**

This Clarity smart contract enables a system where users unlock and mint NFTs by completing specific learning paths or "skill trees." Once a user finishes a learning path, they gain eligibility to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) as verifiable proof of achievement on the blockchain.

---

 3. **Project Vision**

To create a transparent, verifiable, and incentivized learning ecosystem on the blockchain. Each NFT acts as a digital certificate, demonstrating mastery in a specific skill or domain.

 4. **Future Scope**

* Introduce multiple NFT types for different difficulty levels.
* Integrate a decentralized front-end where users can track their progress.
* Add a reputation system based on earned NFTs.
* Enable peer review or DAO-based validation before minting.
* Support NFT transferability and metadata storage for credentials.


 5. **Contract Address**

`SPXXXXXX.../skill-trees-unlocks.clar`
(*To be replaced with the actual deployed contract address once deployed*)
