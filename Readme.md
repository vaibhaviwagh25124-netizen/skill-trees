 1. **Project Title**

Skill Trees with Token Unlocks**


 2. **Project Description**

This Clarity smart contract enables a system where users unlock and mint NFTs by completing specific learning paths or "skill trees." Once a user finishes a learning path, they gain eligibility to mint a non-fungible token (NFT) as verifiable proof of achievement on the blockchain.



 3. **Project Vision**

To create a transparent, verifiable, and incentivized learning ecosystem on the blockchain. Each NFT acts as a digital certificate, demonstrating mastery in a specific skill or domain.

 4. **Future Scope**

* Introduce multiple NFT types for different difficulty levels.
* Integrate a decentralized front-end where users can track their progress.
* Add a reputation system based on earned NFTs.
* Enable peer review or DAO-based validation before minting.
* Support NFT transferability and metadata storage for credentials.
